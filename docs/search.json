    "text": "This book will serve as a record of the activities of the 2022 PsyTeachR Coding Club at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology & Neuroscience. It is in progress and will be updated regularly.\nMaking an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. We’ll cover setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.\nYou will need only very basic R skills and a willingness to learn. The only people this would not be suitable for are those with zero previous experience in R (unless you know you pick up coding languages quickly). If you can install packages and have written an analysis script, you’ll be fine.\n\nRegister for free at EventBrite to help us keep organised and let us know a little bit about your experience. Space is unlimited, so don’t worry if you can’t make all of the dates. We’ll record the sessions and make them public ASAP so you can catch up if you miss the live session.\n\n\nThis book contains all of the instructions to create your first R package. But if you fall behind and need to download the most recent version of the demopkg, visit https://github.com/psyteachr/demopkg and check the README for download instructions.\n\nThe passcode for all recordings will be codingclub22!\n\n\nSetting up a package project (2022-10-05) Recording\nCreate a package project and edit the default files. Well start using the most helpful package, usethis.\n\n\nAdding Data (2022-10-12) Recording\nAdd datasets to your package and document them with a codebook. You can use our demo data or your own.\n\n\nCustom Functions (2022-10-19) Recording\nLearn to write custom functions and include them in your package.\n\n\nDocumentation (2022-10-26) Recording\nWrite function documentation using the roxygen format. This is what creates the help documentation for functions.\n\n\nUnit Tests (2022-11-02) Recording\nWrite unit tests for your custom functions using testthat.\n\n\nAnalysis Vignette (2022-11-09)\nInclude your study analysis code as a package vignette.\n\n\nPkgdown Websites (2022-11-16)\nCreate a package website using pkgdown.\n\n\nPackage Maintenance (2022-11-23)\nHow to run CMD-check to make sure everything is put together right, and how to troubleshoot the inevitable problems.\n\n\nSharing your package (2022-11-30)\nSet up a github account and make a package repository to share your package and pkgdown website.\n\n\nReview and next steps (2022-12-07)\nWhatever we didn’t get to.

If you’re a Windows user, you’ll need RTools; download and install the recommended version. If you’re a Mac user, you’ll need XCode Tools, which you can install by opening the Terminal tab in RStudio (or opening the Terminal application) and typing the following at the command line: xcode-select --install.\nAdditionally, you may need to install LaTeX to make PDF versions of the code documentation.

Follow the directions below for each data set you want to add to your package.\n\n2.1.1 Raw Data Directory\nRun the code below.\n\n# run in the console\nusethis::use_data_raw(\"self_res_att\")\n\nThe first time you run this function in a new package project, it will create a directory called data-raw and add this directory to the .Rbuildignore file so it isn’t included in your package.\n\n\nData Privacy\n\nAny processed data you include in an R package is viewable by anyone who downloads the package. Anything in the data-raw directory is not included in the package, but if you share your whole project publicly on GitHub, people will be able see the raw data and processing code. You can prevent this by adding this directory to .gitignore (which we will discuss in Chapter 9), but it’s pretty easy to make errors that accidentally share everything, so the safest way is to process your data outside the package project if you really can’t share the raw data.\n\nIt will also open a file in that directory called self_res_att.R with the following contents.\n## code to prepare `self_res_att` dataset goes here\n\nusethis::use_data(self_res_att, overwrite = TRUE)\n\n2.1.2 Add Raw Data\nDownload the data file called DeBruine_2004_PRSLB_att.csv from https://osf.io/2ud56/ and save it in data-raw. The code below will also do this.\n\n# run in the console\ndownload.file(url = \"https://osf.io/download/3c5s4/\",\n              destfile = \"data-raw/DeBruine_2004_PRSLB_att.csv\")\n\n\n2.1.3 Load Data\nNow, load the data in this script, using the object name self_res_att; this will be the name of the data object in your package. You will see some message text about the data.\n\nself_res_att <- readr::read_csv(\"data-raw/DeBruine_2004_PRSLB_att.csv\")\n\n\nI use readr::read_csv() so we can fix the column types, but you’re free to use any way you’re comfortable with to load and process the data.\n\n\n2.1.4 Check Column Types\nHave a quick look at the data and make sure the columns import as the right data types. You might want to make sure that categorical factors are imported as factors with their levels in a sensible order.\n\nuse readr::spec(self_res_att) to get the default column types,\ncopy and paste this to your script,\nassign them to an object (here called ct), and\nedit them to set factors with levels in a sensible order\n\n\n# run in the console\nspec(self_res_att)\n\ncols(\n  id = col_character(),\n  sex = col_character(),\n  ethgroup = col_character(),\n  age = col_double(),\n  m_non = col_double(),\n  f_non = col_double(),\n  m_self = col_double(),\n  f_self = col_double(),\n  grpsize = col_double(),\n  group = col_double(),\n  mascpref = col_double(),\n  obro = col_double(),\n  osis = col_double(),\n  ybro = col_double(),\n  ysis = col_double(),\n  birthorder = col_character()\n)\n\n\n\n# add to data-raw/self_res_att.R\nct <- cols(\n  id = col_character(),\n  sex = col_factor(levels = c(\"female\", \"male\")),\n  ethgroup = col_factor(),\n  age = col_double(),\n  m_non = col_double(),\n  f_non = col_double(),\n  m_self = col_double(),\n  f_self = col_double(),\n  grpsize = col_double(),\n  group = col_double(),\n  mascpref = col_double(),\n  obro = col_double(),\n  osis = col_double(),\n  ybro = col_double(),\n  ysis = col_double(),\n  birthorder = col_factor(levels = c(\"only\", \"firstborn\", \"middleborn\", \"lastborn\"))\n)\n\nself_res_att <- readr::read_csv(\"data-raw/DeBruine_2004_PRSLB_att.csv\", col_types = ct)\n\n\n2.1.5 Add Processed Data\nOnce you’re satisfied that the data are in the right form, you can run this code to add the data to your package.\n\n# include in data-raw/self_res_att.R after prep code\nusethis::use_data(self_res_att, overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n✔ Adding 'R' to \\033[32mDepends\\033[39m field in DESCRIPTION\n✔ Setting \\033[32mLazyData\\033[39m to 'true' in 'DESCRIPTION'\n✔ Saving 'self_res_att' to 'data/self_res_att.rda'\n• Document your data (see 'https://r-pkgs.org/data.html')"

    "section": "\n3.1 Function Overview",
    "text": "3.1 Function Overview\nFirst, let’s create a very basic function to learn about custom functions. Functions need a name (like any R object). They are created with the function() function. We’re going to make a function that rounds numbers and keeps the trailing zeroes, so let’s call it round0.\n\nround0 <- function() {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\nMost functions have arguments that set inputs to the function or options for how the function can work. These arguments can be required for the function to work, or have default values.\nCheck the help for the round function; we want our function to work almost the same, so it will be easier for users if the arguments have the same names in the same order, with the same default values. In the example below, the argument digits defaults to 0 unless you change it.\n\nround0 <- function(x, digits = 0) {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\nFunctions use these arguments in their code to produce some kind of output (or side effect). Here, we use the value of digits to create a formatting string, and format the value of x with it using sprintf(). Finally, we use the return() function to return the value.\n\nround0 <- function(x, digits = 0) {\n  fmt <- paste0(\"%.\", digits, \"f\")\n  x0 <- sprintf(fmt, x)\n  \n  return(x0)\n}\n\n\nYou technically don’t have to use the return() function. The last object created in the function code will be automatically returned. Most people don’t use return(), but that can sometimes make it hard to figure out exactly what is being returned if you have a lot of if/else logic.\nThe return() function also stops all subsequent code from being run.\n\nRun the code above to define the function. After it’s defined, if you type the function name into the console, without parentheses, it will show you the code for the function.\n\n# run in the console\nround0\n\nfunction(x, digits = 0) {\n  fmt <- paste0(\"%.\", digits, \"f\")\n  x0 <- sprintf(fmt, x)\n  \n  return(x0)\n}\n\n\n\nYou can do this for any function; try a few! Many of the base R functions, like mean have unsatisfying code like UseMethod(\"mean\"), which you can lean about in the S3 Chapter of Advanced R, but other functions like sd will show you the code they use.\n\nUse your function like any other R function.\n\n# run in the console\nround0(7/3, 3)\nround0(1.9999, 2)\n\n[1] \"2.333\"\n[1] \"2.00\"\n\n\nHowever, you’ll have to define it at the top of any script that uses it, unless you add it to a package."

    "text": "3.2 Function Development\nFor demopkg, we’re going to create a function that produces the APA-formatted text for the results of a paired-samples t-test. Here’s an example of APA format.\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}). There was a {non}significant difference; t({df}) = {t_value}, p = {p_value}.\n\n\n3.2.1 Specific Instance\nThe first step is to sort out a specific instance of your code. We’ll load in the data we added to demopkg in Section 2.1.3.\n\ndata(\"self_res_att\", package = \"demopkg\")\n\nIf you haven’t added the data to your package yet, use this code:\n\nself_res_att <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PsyTeachR/intro-r-pkgs/main/data-raw/DeBruine_2004_PRSLB_att.csv\")\n\nNext, compare preferences for self-resembling female faces (f_self) to others’ preferences for those same faces f_non using a paired-samples t-test.\n\nt_results <- t.test(\n  x = self_res_att$f_self, \n  y = self_res_att$f_non,\n  paired = TRUE)\n\nt_results\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  self_res_att$f_self and self_res_att$f_non\nt = 3.5996, df = 107, p-value = 0.0004845\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2557008 0.8825708\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      0.5691358 \n\n\nNow we set up the text template with variables inside curly brackets where we want to insert values from the analysis. Just make up the variable names, keeping them short but meaningful.\n\ntemplate <- \"A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}). There was a {non}significant difference; t({df}) = {t_value}, p = {p_value}.\"\n\nThe object t_results prints out like above, but the object is actually a list, Use the str() function to see the structure of the list.\n\nstr(t_results)\n\nList of 10\n $ statistic  : Named num 3.6\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"t\"\n $ parameter  : Named num 107\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"df\"\n $ p.value    : num 0.000485\n $ conf.int   : num [1:2] 0.256 0.883\n  ..- attr(*, \"conf.level\")= num 0.95\n $ estimate   : Named num 0.569\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"mean difference\"\n $ null.value : Named num 0\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"mean difference\"\n $ stderr     : num 0.158\n $ alternative: chr \"two.sided\"\n $ method     : chr \"Paired t-test\"\n $ data.name  : chr \"self_res_att$f_self and self_res_att$f_non\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"htest\"\n\n\nNow we can set the value of each variable from the t_results object. You can’t get the means and standard deviations from the t_results object, so we’ll calculate those from the data. Round each numeric value to the appropriate level using the round0 function we created above.\n\nglue::glue(\n  template,\n  dv      = \"preferences for female faces\",\n  level1  = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n  level2  = \"non-self participants\",\n  mean1   = round0(mean(self_res_att$f_self), 1), \n  sd1     = round0(sd(self_res_att$f_self), 1),\n  mean2   = round0(mean(self_res_att$f_non), 1),\n  sd2     = round0(sd(self_res_att$f_non), 1),\n  non     = ifelse(t_results$p.value < .05, \"\", \"non-\"),\n  df      = round0(t_results$parameter, 0),\n  t_value = round0(t_results$statistic, 2),\n  p_value = round0(t_results$p.value, 3)\n)\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare preferences for female faces between participants who resembled those faces (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and non-self participants (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2). There was a significant difference; t(107) = 3.60, p = 0.000.\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about p = 0 just now. A further practice exercise is for you to add code to the function to change it to p < .001 where appropriate.\n\n\n3.2.2 Set up Function\nNow we’re ready to abstract this into a function. The function will need a name. This function will (for now) only give you the APA-style text for a paired-samples t-test, so let’s call it apa_t_pair.\nYou can create an R script in the R directory called apa_t_pair.R, but the code below does this for you.\n\n# run in the console\nusethis::use_r(\"apa_t_pair\")\n\nWe’ll develop our function in this file. To start, set up a blank function definition.\n\napa_t_pair <- function() {\n  \n}\n\nThen add the code above inside the curly brackets.\n\napa_t_pair <- function() {\n  t_results <- t.test(self_res_att$f_self, \n                      self_res_att$f_non,\n                      paired = TRUE)\n  \n  template <- \"A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}). There was a {non}significant difference; t({df}) = {t_value}, p = {p_value}.\"\n  \n  glue::glue(\n    template,\n    dv      = \"preferences for female faces\",\n    level1  = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n    level2  = \"non-self participants\",\n    mean1   = round0(mean(self_res_att$f_self), 1), \n    sd1     = round0(sd(self_res_att$f_self), 1),\n    mean2   = round0(mean(self_res_att$f_non), 1),\n    sd2     = round0(sd(self_res_att$f_non), 1),\n    non     = ifelse(t_results$p.value < .05, \"\", \"non-\"),\n    df      = round0(t_results$parameter, 0),\n    t_value = round0(t_results$statistic, 2),\n    p_value = round0(t_results$p.value, 3)\n  )\n}\n\nSkip a few lines and copy the round0 function definition below this one. You don’t have to define functions in any particular order, as long as all function definitions are run before you try to use them. Run all the code in this file and test that the function works by running it once in the console.\n\n# run in the console\napa_t_pair()\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare preferences for female faces between participants who resembled those faces (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and non-self participants (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2). There was a significant difference; t(107) = 3.60, p = 0.000.\n\n\n\nIf you get the message: Error in apa_t_pair() : could not find function \"apa_t_pair\", this means you didn’t run the code that created the function.\n\n\n3.2.3 Add Arguments\nWe probably want this function to work for any pair of vectors we give it, not just the value of f_self and f_non. So we need to add arguments to the function. Add arguments x and y to the function and replace self_res_att$f_self with x and self_res_att$f_self with y everywhere in the function.\n\napa_t_pair <- function(x, y) {\n  t_results <- t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)\n  \n  template <- \"A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}). There was a {non}significant difference; t({df}) = {t_value}, p = {p_value}.\"\n  \n  glue::glue(\n    template,\n    dv      = \"preferences for female faces\",\n    level1  = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n    level2  = \"non-self participants\",\n    mean1   = round0(mean(x), 1), \n    sd1     = round0(sd(x), 1),\n    mean2   = round0(mean(y), 1),\n    sd2     = round0(sd(y), 1),\n    non     = ifelse(t_results$p.value < .05, \"\", \"non-\"),\n    df      = round0(t_results$parameter, 0),\n    t_value = round0(t_results$statistic,2),\n    p_value = round0(t_results$p.value, 3)\n  )\n}\n\nNow, if you try to run the function without any arguments, you’ll get an error message. This is because there are no default values for x and y.\n\napa_t_pair()\n\nError in t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE): argument \"x\" is missing, with no default\n\n\nThis also won’t work.\n\nx <- self_res_att$f_self\ny <- self_res_att$f_non\napa_t_pair()\n\nError in t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE): argument \"x\" is missing, with no default\n\n\nThis is because the x and y inside of the function are in a different environment to any x and y outside of the function. This can seem confusing at first, but it’s good that you don’t need to worry about objects that exist outside of your function.\nYou can specify the vectors as arguments.\n\n# run in the console or another file\napa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self, \n           y = self_res_att$f_non)\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare preferences for female faces between participants who resembled those faces (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and non-self participants (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2). There was a significant difference; t(107) = 3.60, p = 0.000.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Further Arguments\nNow we can further customise our function. You probably won’t always be comparing “preferences for female faces” between “participants who resembled those faces” and “non-self participants”, so let’s add three new arguments to the function. We can set generic default values for these new arguments so that you don’t have to specify them if the defaults are OK.\nSince the values are defined with the variable names used in the glue template, we don’t need to specify those in the glue() function anymore.\n\napa_t_pair <- function(x, y, \n                       dv = \"the DV\", \n                       level1 = \"level 1\", \n                       level2 = \"level 2\") {\n  t_results <- t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)\n  \n  template <- \"A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}). There was a {non}significant difference; t({df}) = {t_value}, p = {p_value}.\"\n  \n  glue::glue(\n    template,\n    mean1   = round0(mean(x), 1), \n    sd1     = round0(sd(x), 1),\n    mean2   = round0(mean(y), 1),\n    sd2     = round0(sd(y), 1),\n    non     = ifelse(t_results$p.value < .05, \"\", \"non-\"),\n    df      = round0(t_results$parameter, 0),\n    t_value = round0(t_results$statistic,2),\n    p_value = round0(t_results$p.value, 3)\n  )\n}\n\nTry running the function both with and without the new arguments.\n\napa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self, \n           y = self_res_att$f_non)\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the DV between level 1 (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and level 2 (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2). There was a significant difference; t(107) = 3.60, p = 0.000.\n\n\n\napa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self, \n           y = self_res_att$f_non,\n           dv = \"preferences for female faces\",\n           level1 = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n           level2 = \"non-self participants\")\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare preferences for female faces between participants who resembled those faces (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and non-self participants (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2).

These are called “dependencies” because your function depends on them. Our function above uses glue() from the glue package. The function below is a quick way to add a dependency.\n\n# run in the console\nusethis::use_package(\"glue\")\n\nYou should see this output:\n\n✔ Setting active project to '/Users/lisad/rproj/demopkg'\n✔ Adding 'glue' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION\n• Refer to functions with `glue::fun()`\n\nThis means that you should always use the full form glue::glue(), rather than loading a package with the library() function and using just the function name glue().\nYou can open the DESCRIPTION file to see what has changed. Alternatively, you can manually add dependencies to this file under “Imports:”.\n\n3.3.2 Load\nNow restart R and make sure that your environment is clear. Run the following code to load your package. You can also use a keyboard shortcut to run this function (Mac: cmd-shift-L, Windows: ctl-shift-L).\n\n# run in the console\ndevtools::load_all(\".\")\n\nThe function should now be available.\n\napa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self, \n           y = self_res_att$f_non,\n           dv = \"preferences for female faces\",\n           level1 = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n           level2 = \"non-self participants\")\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare preferences for female faces between participants who resembled those faces (M = 3.5, SD = 1.6) and non-self participants (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2).

There was a significant difference; t(107) = 3.89, p = 0.000.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Check\nRun the CMD check using devtools::check() or by clicking the Check icon in the Build tab. There will be a lot of grey output text, and hopefully a lot of green checkmarks. But at the end, you’ll probably get a message like this:\n\n❯ checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE\n  apa_t_pair: no visible global function definition for ‘t.test’\n  apa_t_pair: no visible global function definition for ‘sd’\n  Undefined global functions or variables:\n    sd t.test\n  Consider adding\n    importFrom(\"stats\", \"sd\", \"t.test\")\n  to your NAMESPACE file.\n\n0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 1 note ✖\n\nR CMD check succeeded\n\nThe no visible global function definition note means that we’ve used some functions that aren’t from our own package and we haven’t specified what package they are from. t.test and sd are functions from the stats package, which is automatically loaded when you start up R, but still needs to be added as a dependency.\nYou can add the stats:: prefix to t.test and sd and add the dependency using usethis::use_package(\"stats\").\n\nThe part that suggests you add importFrom(\"stats\", \"sd\", \"t.test\") to the NAMESAPCE file is a way for you to add specific functions from another package to your package so you can use them without specifying the package name first. However, that specific instruction should be ignored because you should never edit the NAMESPACE file yourself. Instead use roxygen to set this up, which will be explained in Section 4.3.\n\n\n3.3.4 Install\nWhen you’re developing a package, you usually “load” it using devtools::load_all(\".\") to be able to access all of the functions in the package for testing and development. This way, the development package is only available during the current session in this project. You will load it every time you make some changes to the package.\nIf you want your package to be available outside of project sessions where you’ve explicitly loaded it, you need to install the package using devtools::install() or the Install button in the Build pane.\nAfter your package is installed, make sure the environment is clear, and try the following code:\n\nround0(1, 3)\n\nError in round0(1, 3): could not find function \"round0\"\n\n\nThis is because round0 is an internal, non-exported function, so only the developer (you) is supposed to be able to use it. Technically, you can also access internal functions using the triple-colon.\n\ndemopkg:::round0(1, 3)\n\n[1] \"1.000\""

It should generate documentation code in roxygen format like this:\n#' Title\n#'\n#' @param x\n#' @param y\n#' @param dv\n#' @param level1\n#' @param level2\n#'\n#' @return\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\nThis creates the help files you can see for any function. For example, type ?t.test in the console.\n\n4.1.1 Title and Description\nThe first line of the roxygen documentation is the title and the paragraph under that is the description. If you have more than one paragraph of description, you need to add the @description tag. Update your documentation like this:\n#' APA text for Paired-Samples T-Test\n#' \n#' @description\n#' Create APA-formatted text for the results of an independent-samples t-test in the following format:\n#'\n#' A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare \\{dv\\} between \\{level1\\} (M = \\{mean1\\}, SD = \\{sd1\\}) and \\{level2\\} (M = \\{mean2\\}, SD = \\{sd2\\}). There was a \\{non\\}significant difference; t(\\{df\\}) = \\{t_value\\}, p = \\{p_value\\}.\n\nThe curly brackets need to be prefaced by a backslash so they will show as literal curly brackets in the Help files, rather than be interpreted as markdown syntax.\n\n\n4.1.2 Arguments\nThe “Arguments” section is created from the lines that start with @param. They should define each argument in the function.\n#' @param x A vector of the values for level 1.\n#' @param y A vector of the values for level 2.\n#' @param dv The text describing the DV in the output statement.\n#' @param level1 The text describing level 1 in the output statement.\n#' @param level2 The text describing level 2 in the output statement.\n\n4.1.3 Return Value\nThe line starting with @return creates the “Value” section. This tells the user what kind of object is returned from the function. The line @export tells the package that this is a function you want others to be able to use; if you omit this, the function will only be available internally to your package.\n#' @return A character string.\n#' @export\n\n4.1.4 Examples\nAdd at least one example that shows how the function works. Make sure to create any objects you need to run the function. Here, we can use the data object self_res_att because we added it to our package in Chapter 2.\n#' @examples\n#' # use generic text\n#' apa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self,\n#'            y = self_res_att$f_non)\n#'\n#' # specify the text for dv and levels\n#' apa_t_pair(x = self_res_att$f_self,\n#'            y = self_res_att$f_non,\n#'            dv = \"preferences for female faces\",\n#'            level1 = \"participants who resembled those faces\",\n#'            level2 = \"non-self participants\")"

Then write a test that checks if your function is doing that new thing. It will, of course, fail, but then your task is to alter the function code until the test passes.\nFor example, it would be nice to give a custom error message if x and y are identical, since this is almost always a mistake and you can’t calculate any test statistics.\n\nx <- c(1,2,1,4,1)\napa_t_pair(x, x)\n\nA paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the DV between level 1 (M = 1.8, SD = 1.3) and level 2 (M = 1.8, SD = 1.3). There was a NAsignificant difference; t(4) = NaN, p = NaN.\n\n\n\nYou may get an error above instead of “There was a NAsignificant difference; t(4) = NaN, p = NaN.”, this means that you’ve changed a default setting, but I’m having trouble figuring out what (one of my computers returns an error and two return the text above). I’ll update this when I figure it out. Regardless, we want to replace that opaque error with an intelligible error.\n\nThe first step is to write a test that fails. Wrap the code apa_t_pair(x, x) inside the function expect_error(), which will pass if the code produces the specified error message and fail if it doesn’t.\n\n# add to tests/testthat/apa_t_pair.R\n\ntest_that(\"same x and y\", {\n  x <- c(1,2,1,4,1)\n  \n  expect_error( apa_t_pair(x, x), \n                regexp = \"x and y cannot be identical\",\n                fixed = TRUE )\n})\n\nError in `reporter$stop_if_needed()`:\n! Test failed\n\n\n── Failure ('<text>:6'): same x and y ──────────────────────────────────────────\n`apa_t_pair(x, x)` did not throw an error.\n\n\nNow we can edit the function apa_t_pair() (in the file R/apa_t_pair.R) until the test passes. Add a few lines of code at the start of the function to check if all of the values in x are the same as all of the values in y, and display an error message if they are.\n\n# edit R/apa_t_pair.R\n\napa_t_pair <- function(x, y, \n                       dv = \"the DV\", \n                       level1 = \"level 1\", \n                       level2 = \"level 2\") {\n  # warn about identical values\n  if (all(x == y)) {\n    stop(\"x and y cannot be identical\")\n  }\n  \n  t_results <- t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)\n  \n  template <- \"A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare {dv} between {level1} (M = {mean1}, SD = {sd1}) and {level2} (M = {mean2}, SD = {sd2}).
