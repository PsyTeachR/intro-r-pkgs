This book will serve as a record of the activities of the 2022 [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io) Coding Club at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology & Neuroscience. It is in progress and will be updated regularly.

Making an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. We’ll cover setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.

You will need only very basic R skills and a willingness to learn. The only people this would not be suitable for are those with zero previous experience in R (unless you know you pick up coding languages quickly). If you can install packages and have written an analysis script, you'll be fine.

## Demo Package

This book contains all of the instructions to create your first R package. But if you fall behind and need to download the most recent version of the demopkg, visit <https://github.com/psyteachr/demopkg> and check the README for download instructions. 

## Tentative Schedule

The passcode for all recordings will be `codingclub22!`

1. Setting up a package project (2022-10-05) [Recording](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/mxeupKeSgQ7ZekH86RV1UQ-4ROAv6xQoJRB7G2Z7lnLovcTGdVVs39mRb1q7cvZn.UYy6h6E6Sc6xOCOr)

    Create a package project and edit the default files. Well start using the most helpful package, usethis.

2. Adding Data (2022-10-12) [Recording](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/o0RHg82nSsyPLSMpA5hxHdqiHnc86H7zmBvzDL-n6ICqq0NQ1wHf8FKF3zvkeGmj.H72yZQDGbVST5gqQ)

    Add datasets to your package and document them with a codebook. You can use our demo data or your own.

3. Custom Functions (2022-10-19) [Recording](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/GsdzG_rdN-ifbRqRndm-lUKXYNqf8dQB12tnkJwmWD2Z8Po4koqArTcHFtH-DXlx.QLwfu5cwMgQ3OCK3)

    Learn to write custom functions and include them in your package.

4. Documentation (2022-10-26) [Recording](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/sOMxVB9wd084RpyVbz_HyFh1tTLP3PqmQVMBBONNc4SucxDYp8u4XSlujlnj7ZW4.egNs8uuVGd1Al5oR)

    Write function documentation using the roxygen format. This is what creates the help documentation for functions.
    
5. Unit Tests (2022-11-02)

    Write unit tests for your custom functions using testthat.

6. Analysis Vignette (2022-11-09)

    Include your study analysis code as a package vignette.

7. Pkgdown Websites (2022-11-16)

    Create a package website using pkgdown.

8. Package Maintenance (2022-11-23)

    How to run CMD-check to make sure everything is put together right, and how to troubleshoot the inevitable problems.

9. Sharing your package (2022-11-30)

    Set up a github account and make a package repository to share your package and pkgdown website.

10. Review and next steps (2022-12-07)

    Whatever we didn’t get to. We'll also discuss how to continue your learning.
