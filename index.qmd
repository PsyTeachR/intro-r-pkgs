# Overview {.unnumbered}

Making an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. Weâ€™ll cover setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.

You will need only very basic R skills and a willingness to learn. The only people this would not be suitable for are those with zero previous experience in R (unless you know you pick up coding languages quickly). If you can install packages and have written an analysis script, you'll be fine.

## Demo Package

This book contains all of the instructions to create your first R package. But if you fall behind and need to download the most recent version of the demopkg, visit <https://github.com/psyteachr/demopkg> and check the README for download instructions. 

## Schedule

This originally ran as a weekly online workshop in 2022 for the [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io) Coding Club at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology & Neuroscience. The videos are on a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2iRWVwbpTLPSdIM8peMcpzeVDPAQvfc).

1. Setting up a package project (2022-10-05) [Recording](https://youtu.be/XiM4jFJ6ocY)

    Create a package project and edit the default files. Well start using the most helpful package, usethis.

2. Adding Data (2022-10-12) [Recording](https://youtu.be/trKL8YMXh1U)

    Add datasets to your package and document them with a codebook. You can use our demo data or your own.

3. Custom Functions (2022-10-19) [Recording]( https://youtu.be/ebpEA0UaG0I)

    Learn to write custom functions and include them in your package.

4. Documentation (2022-10-26) [Recording](https://youtu.be/DGJJ5bX4090)

    Write function documentation using the roxygen format. This is what creates the help documentation for functions.
    
5. Unit Tests (2022-11-02) [Recording](https://youtu.be/nGLur5zwLPY)

    Write unit tests for your custom functions using testthat.

6. Vignettes (2022-11-09) [Recording](https://youtu.be/nxX9zfP91dM)

    Include your study analysis code as a package vignette.

7. Pkgdown Websites (2022-11-16) [Recording](https://youtu.be/IRtOORWdKGI)

    Create a package website using pkgdown.

8. Package Maintenance (2022-11-23) [Recording](https://youtu.be/Q0HRweq2s8I)

    How to run CMD-check to make sure everything is put together right, and how to troubleshoot the inevitable problems.

9. Sharing your package (2022-12-07) [Recording](https://youtu.be/C-zGrJda4rU)

    Set up a github account and make a package repository to share your package and pkgdown website.
